# Context retaining chatbot

This project implements a chatbot backend using LangChain with support for contextual memory, enabling more human-like and continuous conversations. It demonstrates how to:

- Integrate language models with memory for chat history retention
- Build a flexible, extendable backend for contextual applications
- Support multi-turn conversations with user-specific session memory

Ideal for developers building AI assistants, customer support agents, or any use case requiring stateful interaction with LLMs.
